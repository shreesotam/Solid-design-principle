Solid design principles are fundamental guidelines for creating well-structured, maintainable, and scalable software.
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
   Every class should have one and only one reason to change.
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
   Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
   Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
   A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it doesn't use.
